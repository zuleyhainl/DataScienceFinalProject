- https://www.kaggle.com/niduttnb/you-kinda-look-sus-among-us-tips-and-tricks/data (Here, we reach the datasets with the game data of 25 different players in total. However, since the game data in some datasets are inconsistent/incomplete, we took the data of users (1,2,10,12,18) who played 100 games from these datasets.) <br /> <br />
We scrape the other datas from steamcharts.com <br /> <br />
All of the datasets I've used can be found in datasets folder <br /> <br />
